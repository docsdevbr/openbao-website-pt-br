# `/sys/seal`

The `/sys/seal` endpoint seals the OpenBao.

## Seal

This endpoint seals the OpenBao. In HA mode, only an active node can be sealed.
Standby nodes should be restarted to get the same effect. Requires a token with
`root` policy or `sudo` capability on the path.

| Method | Path        |
| :----- | :---------- |

# Bootstrapping kubernetes auth method

:::warning

**Important Note:** This chart is not compatible with Helm 2. Please use Helm 3.6+ with this chart.

:::

In this example, we will walk through how to set up the [Kubernetes Auth Method](../../../../auth/kubernetes.mdx).

This assumes the following commands will be run inside a OpenBao pod running in Kubernetes.

Exec into the OpenBao pod:

```bash
kubectl exec -it openbao-0 -- /bin/sh
```

If you didn't set `server.dev.enabled=true`, you'll need to log in to OpenBao first using `openbao login`.
Then run the following commands to configure the Kubernetes Auth Method:

```bash
openbao auth enable kubernetes
openbao write auth/kubernetes/config \
    kubernetes_host=https://$KUBERNETES_SERVICE_HOST:$KUBERNETES_SERVICE_PORT
```

From here you can continue to configure OpenBao from the [Kubernetes Auth Method](../../../../auth/kubernetes.mdx) documentation.

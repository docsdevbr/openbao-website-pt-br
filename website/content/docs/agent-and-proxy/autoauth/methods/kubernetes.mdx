# OpenBao Auto-Auth kubernetes method

The `kubernetes` method reads in a Kubernetes service account token from the
running pod (via `/var/run/secrets/kubernetes.io/serviceaccount/token`) and
sends it to the [Kubernetes Auth
method](../../../auth/kubernetes.mdx).

## Configuration

- `role` `(string: required)` - The role to authenticate against on OpenBao
- `token_path` `(string: optional)` - The file path to a custom JWT token to use
  for authentication. If omitted, the default service account token path is used.

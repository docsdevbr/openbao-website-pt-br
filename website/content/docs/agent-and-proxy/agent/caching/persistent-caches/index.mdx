# OpenBao agent persistent caching

OpenBao Agent can restore tokens and leases from a persistent cache file created
by a previous OpenBao Agent process. The persistent cache is a BoltDB file that
includes tuples encrypted by a generated encryption key. The encrypted tuples
include the OpenBao token used to retrieve secrets, leases for tokens/secrets, and
secret values.

:::info

**Note:** OpenBao Agent Persistent Caching will only restore _leased_
secrets. Secrets that are not renewable, such as KV v2, will not be persisted.

:::

In order to use OpenBao Agent persistent cache, auto-auth must be used. If the
auto-auth token has expired by the time the cache is restored, the cache will
be invalidated and secrets will need to be re-fetched from OpenBao.

If OpenBao Agent templating is enabled alongside of the persistent cache, OpenBao
Agent will automatically route templating requests through the cache. This
ensures template requests are cached and restored properly.

:::info

**Note** OpenBao Agent persistent cache is currently supported only in a
Kubernetes environment.

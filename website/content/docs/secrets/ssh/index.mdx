# SSH secrets engine

Name: `ssh`

The OpenBao SSH secrets engine provides secure authentication and authorization
for access to machines via the SSH protocol. The OpenBao SSH secrets engine helps
manage access to machine infrastructure, providing several ways to issue SSH
credentials.

The OpenBao SSH secrets engine supports the following modes. Each mode is
individually documented on its own page.

- [Signed SSH Certificates](signed-ssh-certificates.mdx)
- [One-time SSH Passwords](one-time-ssh-passwords.mdx)

All guides assume a basic familiarity with the SSH protocol.

## API

The SSH secrets engine has a full HTTP API. Please see the
[SSH secrets engine API](/api-docs/secret/ssh) for more

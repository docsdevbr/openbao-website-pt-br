# operator rotate

The `operator rotate` rotates the underlying encryption key which is used to
secure data written to the storage backend. This installs a new key in the key
ring. This new key is used to encrypted new data, while older keys in the ring
are used to decrypt older data.

This is an online operation and does not cause downtime. This command is run
per-cluster (not per-server), since OpenBao servers in HA mode share the same
storage backend.

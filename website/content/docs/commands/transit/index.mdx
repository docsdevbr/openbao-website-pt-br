# transit

The `transit` command groups subcommands for interacting with OpenBao's
[Transit Secrets Engine](../../secrets/transit/index.mdx).

## Syntax

## Examples

To [import](import.mdx) keys into a mount via the
[Transit BYOK](../../secrets/transit/index.mdx#bring-your-own-key-byok)
mechanism, use the `bao transit import <path> <key>` or
`bao transit import-version <path> <key>` commands:

```
$ bao transit import transit/keys/test-key @test-key type=rsa-2048
Retrieving transit wrapping key.
Wrapping source key with ephemeral key.
Encrypting ephemeral key with transit wrapping key.
Submitting wrapped key to OpenBao transit.
Success!
```

# Filesystem storage backend

The Filesystem storage backend stores OpenBao's data on the filesystem using a
standard directory structure. It can be used for durable single server
situations, or to develop locally where durability is not critical.

:::warning

**No High Availability** – the Filesystem backend does not support high
availability. Only a single OpenBao node may use this data store.

:::


:::danger

**Not Production Recommended** – the Filesystem storage backend is not
recommended for production installations as it is not transactional and lacks
system-level file locking.

:::

```hcl
storage "file" {
  path = "/mnt/openbao/data"
}
```

Even though OpenBao's data is encrypted at rest, you should still take appropriate
measures to secure access to the filesystem.

## `file` parameters

- `path` `(string: <required>)` – The absolute path on disk to the directory
  where the data will be stored. If the directory does not exist, OpenBao will
  create it.

## `file` examples

This example shows the Filesystem storage backend being mounted at
`/mnt/openbao/data`.

```hcl
storage "file" {
  path = "/mnt/openbao/data"
}
```
